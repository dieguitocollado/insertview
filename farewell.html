            <p style="color: white;">My grandfather died four years before I was born. It was cancer, and it only took a few months. That was how I always knew him; my mother never thought death to be a taboo subject, and had told me nonchalantly about her father’s passing since
                I was a young child. It was until recently, when I excitedly told my mother about&nbsp;<em>The Farewell</em>’s existence, that she told me another side to the story of his death.&nbsp;<br></p>

        <div style="font-size: larger;margin-top: 30px;">
            <p id="first-paragraph">“His mother never knew,” she said. He died in his fifties, at least a decade before my great grandmother did. The family decided not to tell her, in respect and fear that it would break her heart and she would die of grief. His death was a
                secret the family carried to her grave. Whenever she’d ask for him, they’d say that he was busy, or out of town visiting my mother. After years of deflection, we realized it was too late to go back; the delayed news would have hurt her
                even more than told on time, and we didn’t want to&nbsp; think about the consequences. <br></p>
            <p style="/*background-color: white;*/">While not solely restricted to Chinese families, this is the reality of an all-too familiar Chinese experience; to keep secrets from each other under the guise of protection and filial piety, especially in the face of grief. Carrying our own
                burdens and secrets, we are only bearers of good news. “The Chinese have a saying: when you get cancer, you die. Not because of the cancer, but because of the fear.” This line from The Farewell contains a certain wisdom that fuels the
                premise of Lulu Wang’s bittersweet film: that death is about perspective. You could either live out happily planning your grandson’s (fake) wedding, reunited with the ones you love, or you could die worrying every day is your last. So
                why make it such a big deal? The catch is that this perspective is not held by all, but rather chosen for Nainai by Billi’s (Awkwafina) family. <br></p>
            <p>We all should have a right to know about our own health – to the Western mind especially, this autonomy is common sense. The thought of the familial collective deciding what is best for you seems, to some, absurd, and to others, a problematic
                case of control and secrecy. However, I cannot dismiss this aspect of non-communication as yet another black-and-white flaw ingrained in our cultural behaviour; this is a topic I approach with conflicting feelings, growing tired of the
                East set against the ‘normalcy’ of the West. Especially in films made for American audiences showing how strange and self-sabotaging the traditionalists are (See: Crazy Rich Asians). Sitting down for The Farewell, it was heartwarming to
                see her handle this manifestation of non-communication so delicately, no longer choosing one culture over the other, but rather highlighting the nuances we face when it comes to internalised conflicts over cultural behaviour. <br></p>
            <p
                style="padding-bottom: 20px;">A critic, after describing the film as having an “absurd premise”, received criticism for his ignorance and narrow world view. He deserved the backlash he received, but I do think&nbsp;the theme of absurdity nonetheless exists in the film.
                The film opens&nbsp;with a perspective that is comfortable for a primary Western audience so that they can easily identify with Billi. The situation plays up absurdity: shots of our cast front-facing the camera with uniform inexplicable
                expressions recurs throughout the film (and poster), and the blue-trenched, minimalist and brutalist photography of Chinese scenes reflect a clinical depiction of the country. The matter-of-fact acceptance of the situation from her family
                is even played as Kafkaesque, accompanied with short, simple dialogue as Billi observes this foreign world she is placed in. It is clear that we are transported into the world of the Oriental other, and this treatment of Chinese culture
                from American cinema is hardly unique or special.&nbsp;<br></p>
                <div data-bs-parallax-bg="true" style="background-image: url(assets/img/Screen-Shot-2019-05-06-at-5.13.30-PM.png);background-position: center;background-size: cover;height: 476px;"></div>
                <p style="margin-top: 0px;padding-top: 20px;">As the film goes on, Billi crosses over to even actively hide the reality from Nainai at The Farewell’s emotional height. The brutalist buildings began to carry an amicable presence, and we witness small contained moments of humour and
                    love during Chinese day-to-day life. Knowing the premise and expecting myself to cry bundles of tears, I instead found myself laughing at the relatable cultural markers. In one particularly notable scene, the family visits Yeye (Grandpa)’s
                    grave, and the sons light up a cigarette as an offering that is quickly disputed over – “Don’t give him that, he quit”. “He lied, he never quit.”&nbsp;W&nbsp;hile Nainai’s insistence on bowing after every rather trivial wish is another
                    portrayal of the absurd, it felt more like an in-joke about the elders and filial piety than another showcase of a strange Orient. Moments like this subvert the expectations of the film’s primary Western audience, slowly easing them
                    into a culture that is not theirs but no longer an ‘other’. It rejects any sort of melodrama that could feed into a more stereotypical tale of a lie-gone-wrong, as this is simply the reality many find themselves in.<br></p>
                <p>Billi’s journey is ultimately a process of coming to terms with her roots, with understanding why these secrets are so complicatedly kept, and accepting their emotional weight. The distinctive second-generation diaspora perspective – which
                    is Wang’s own, with the film being autobiographical – was crucial in maintaining a nuanced perspective. In the scene where her parents argue with relatives over being Chinese or American – reiterating the American Dream – Billi interjects
                    by pointing out that America has many issues of its own. The patriotic optimism found in first generation migrants is diminished by the second, and with it, a change in attitude towards these cultural conflicts and questions of “what
                    is the right thing to do.”&nbsp;<br></p>
                <p>Diasporic identities are complex; the merging of cultures does not always go smoothly, and accepting your own hybridity is never easy. Watching Wang’s’s story unfold is fascinating, her cultural conflicts resonating with me as she brings
                    out a familiar repression of negative emotions, the recognisable problem in communicating love and care, and the familiar struggle of homecoming. I wish that these familiarities were not present in my experiences or culture, but they
                    are, and The Farewell is a beautiful and quiet cinematic reflection that captures the crossroads of diasporic unease , unconditional love for your family and culture, and the messy reconciliation that follows.&nbsp;<br></p>
                <p>My grandfather’s story represents only one of many complicated white lies within my own family history. As long as death and dying remain taboo subjects, the choice between repression or communication will persist. My mother ultimately
                    regretted our family’s choice and we collectively agreed to communicate more openly, to stop hiding major family events for each other’s “own good.” She felt that great-grandma probably had a hunch – in The Farewell, Wang implies Nainai
                    did too. However, I believe both women would have understood the reasons for the lie and forgiven our families for it; if forgiveness was even a question. Watching Nainai, Wang’s real grandmother, exercising at the end of the film
                    – healthily, blossoming in happiness – I am grateful that a little movie like this exists. The Farewell tells, without judgement, the story of how and why our lies and secrets come to be, and prompts similar stories to finally be unearthed.<br></p>
