	<p>Sometimes cities can be as important to a film as the characters
themselves – to the point where, in some cases, the city becomes a
character in itself. This is the case in Before Sunrise, a film that
tells the story of the brief but profound meeting of Jesse and Celine,
who spend the night walking around the city of Vienna. The film centres
itself completely around the conversations of the couple, who slowly
(but also quickly – the story takes place over the course of about 12
hours) fall in love with one another. As a result, other characters –
the people they meet and interact with on the way: the arguing couple,
the amateur Viennese actors, the fortune-teller, the poet – only get a
few minutes on screen. I would argue that these minor characters are
parts of a large whole – they collectively become the character of the
city of Vienna, along with the actual physical location, which gains a
livelihood of its own over the course of the film.</p>

<p>There are many shots throughout the film in which Celine and Jesse
slowly walk out of view, their conversation dimming out, and the
viewer’s eye is instead directed to other figures in the frame: the
people of Vienna. This brings to my mind the idea that Celine and
Jesse’s story is just one of the many stories that are taking place and
have taken place in that beautiful city as they walk through it. This is
a familiar feeling that I don’t quite know the name for, the feeling
that you are just one character in a never-ending, chronologically
ordered end credits sequence. I often get this feeling in train stations
or airport arrival areas, when I am sitting waiting for my train or
aeroplane, and observing the scenes of arguments, first meetings,
emotional reunions. Linklater captures this feeling very well in
focusing as much on the city of Vienna as he does on the relationship
between Jesse and Celine.</p>

<p>The sequence in the film that really strikes me every time I watch it is
near the end, where Linklater shows a series of shots of the locations
that Jesse and Celine “inhabited” (as the script phrases it) over the
course of the night, and are now being touched by the light of the early
morning.</p>

<p>Here are some of my own photos of Vienna (taken on 35mm in an attempt to
get closer to the idea of 1990’s Vienna like the Vienna from the film?)
set next to my descriptions of the ‘empty’ shots of Vienna from this
sequence in Before Sunrise:</p>

<p>Eye-level shot showing the green bridge that Celine and Jesse walked on
when they first got to Vienna; no one is discernible in the shot and the
only thing moving is a train passing by underneath: we see the whole
train pass by and then the shot lingers for a few seconds.</p>

<p>(PHOTO)</p>

<p>Zoomed out shot of the boat-restaurant Jesse and Celine ate at; the only
thing moving is the water of the river Danube passing by past the boat;
then close up shot of the table Jesse and Celine were sitting at, with a
bridge in the background, on which cars are driving by in the distance.</p>

<p>(PHOTO)</p>

<p>Eye-level shot of the Albertina balcony, with the view of the Opera
House and Albertinaplatz; no one sitting on the balustrade (although the
presence of the young couple lingers); no other figures in the shot; a
couple of vans drive by.</p>

<p>(PHOTO)</p>

<p>Eye-level shot of the alleyway where Celine and Jesse sat to talk about
the differences between men and women; again, no one is in the shot but
the audience can definitely feel the presence of the couple sitting
there just a few hours before.</p>

<p>(PHOTO)</p>

<p>Eye-level shot of the graveyard that Celine and Jesse visited; no
figures in the shot except dozens of little white statuettes of Jesus
attached to the top of the graves.</p>

<p>(PHOTO)</p>

<p>Zoomed out, slightly high angle shot of the Kleines Cafe where Celine
had her hand read by a fortune-teller; now an old man with a yellow
shopping bag crosses the square alone – the theme of time passing is
picked up subtly here.</p>

<p>(PHOTO)</p>

<p>Distant shot of the park where Celine and Jesse sat down in the middle
of the night to have wine and stay there until dawn; it looks different
in the morning light – you can see the buildings in the distance;
there’s an old lady walking across the shot (again a nod to the theme of
time), and she passes a spot on the grass where there seems to be the
remains of a wine bottle and glasses.</p>
